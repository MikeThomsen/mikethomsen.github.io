    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I work in the metropolitan D.C. area as a data engineer, focused mainly on Apache NiFi work. Most of my contributions to Apache NiFi have been focused on HBase, MongoDB and ElasticSearch-related improvements. NiFi bundles that are featured here tend to relate to problems that I am working on for clients. All code featured here is licensed under the ASL v2 license unless stated otherwise.</p>
