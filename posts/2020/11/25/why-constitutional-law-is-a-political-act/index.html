    <p>Both sides of the aisle in American politics like to accuse the judiciary of being <em>activist</em> when it makes a ruling that they don't like and seems to favor another faction. "Stop playing politics!" many people demand, but that's really not possible because the very concept of "separate but equal" branches that includes a judiciary implicitly creates a political judiciary, especially in federal disputes.</p>
<p>The fact of arbitrating a dispute between two state governments is as much an act of political balance as legality. It is using formal legal process in lieu of a king deciding between two governors or squabbling fiefs or using force of arms to settle the dispute for that matter. </p>
<p>Politics is fundamentally nothing more than the use of authority to settle a dispute and bind the disputants to accept the outcome. It happens when a parent decides between two siblings, or when a court orders two state governments to obey the outcome of their suit. Law itself is nothing more than a set of rules given by a lawgiver acting political to set up a framework to impose order.</p>
<p>The presence of a Bill of Rights, combined with the incorporation language of the 14th Amendment, requires the federal judiciary to frequently intercede and make inherently political judgments using the formal processes of law. Is this law acceptable under the First Amendment? Does that gun regulation violate the Second Amendment? Can a particularly search be squared with the fourth? So on and so fourth. Each of these decisions is inherently political while also being legal.</p>
<p>What complicates things further is the fact that many disputes brought under the Bill of Rights and 14th Amendment put absolutist text up against particular laws that may be needed to achieve some other societal good. Consider the text of the First Amendment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The indisputable fact is that the First Amendment is absolutist. It allows literally no exceptions, even for defamation, sharing troop movements, inciting mass murder. In fact, if we buy the idea that pornograph is "speech," then it means that all anti-child pornography laws are unconstitutional as well.</p>
<p>What the courts realized very early into our republic's history, though they have never to my knowledge forthrightly said as much, is that not even the federal government could function if the Bill of Rights were to be enforced as written. Again, as written, the first amendment alone would nullify almost all national security laws, even going so far as to not allow the enforcement of any law that would give the military authority to restrict the speech of members serving in a warzone.</p>
<p>The job of the judiciary in such cases is to try to force a square peg to fit into a round hole without cracking or destroying the round hole. Much constitutional law exists for the very purpose of ensuring that the amendment does not become a dead letter part of our legal code and to ensure further that it is respectabled as much as possible <em>within the limits of reason and necessity</em>.</p>
<p>The practical effect of this is that constitutional law is not so much what the constitution naturally means or requires, but the authoritative facts on the ground of what <strong>will</strong> be done in interpretting the constitution in a political manner that hopefully smoothes out many of its inherent flaws. The consequence of this is that telling someone they are wrong about constitutionality is often nothing more than a naked appeal to authority. They very well may not be wrong, they just hold a very different intrepretation of vague and pithy text and how it should be applied to a particular controversy.</p>
<p>People who would limit the First Amendment to literal printing presses and people who would argue it applies to every form of publication are not wrong, but using a different heuristic for interpreting the amendment. The latter is far more compelling to the vast majority of people and also the courts because the "intent" of the men who wrote the Constitution is an easy way to figure out how to apply text from the 18th century consistently to 21st century disputes. It also holds up well and requires less political action, but that doesn't mean it is <em>objectively correct</em> and the literal interpretation is <em>objectively wrong</em>.</p>
<p>A genuine act of political activism by a judiciary can be seen right now in Pennsylvania where the state's supreme court ignored statutory law altogether and established its own rules by using the state constitution as a fig leaf. Like many, I do believe that COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, but it is not so dangerous as to justify such a measure. It is not as though the election coincided with an outbreak of a new strain of Smallpox that is completely resistant to existing medicine, and the courts were faced with a credible threat of people being denied a constitutional right. It was thus usurpation of another branch's authority.</p>
<p>What people need to understand is that politics is not something that happens "over there" in city hall or the capitol. Man is a political animal by nature. Even in a group of four strangers working together, there will be a political arrangement, no matter how crude, for resolving questions and deciding how to act. There is always a political element to judiciaries, as they are extensions of the lawgiver. It's just that for better or for worse, we have created a system that frequently forces the judiciary to engage in political resolutions as a peer to the "political branches" that draft and sign the statutes.</p>
