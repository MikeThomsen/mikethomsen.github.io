    <p>First of all, I admit that there were some really good counter-points at HN to some of the issues I raised. One of which was Barnes v Yahoo!, however many of the commenters failed to note that I raised quite a few scenarios that they didn't address. Some of those don't appear to be defeated by <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2019/12/breach-of-contract-promissory-estoppel-claims-bypass-section-230-but-fail-anyways-yue-v-miao.htm">Eric Goldman's take</a> (which was cited). Ex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) 47 USC 230 does not preempt a claim for promissory estoppel that a third party might have against a website that promises to take down third party tortious content and fails to do so. To me, this is just another way of saying that websites can be liable for the words they choose (1st party content) even if those words relate to user content (third party content).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A hosting service bouncing your content summarily would not fall under this. They are, in fact, claiming to enforce their contract with you. The issue is that S230 gives them blanket protection from anything they can assert is a "good faith" finding that the content is "objectionable." Claims of "disinformation" would easily fall into this category.</p>
<p>These examples aren't ones I necessarily care about, but examples of speech that could easily be stomped under S230:</p>
<ol>
<li>A host discovers it is hosting a vaccine skeptic blog, and summarily terminates service.</li>
<li>A host discovers it is hosting a young Earth creationist documentary, and deletes the content on the basis that they "object to spreading disinformation."</li>
<li>A host is contacted by a company criticized on a blog, and they find the content objectionable because they "don't like mean-spirited content."</li>
</ol>
<p>Hosts do give themselves tremendous room to remove content, but it is governed by contract law. This means that the judge can make rulings like one acknowledging that the host was legally in the right to terminate service, but so awful in their method of doing it that damages are possible. S230, as written--not as interpreted by a judiciary trying to patch the law together--grants near blanket immunity the way I read it.</p>
<p>Through judicial interpretation, these things often get blunted. If we take the first amendment at face value, the National Security Act of 1947 and the Espionage Act are unconstitutional as they involving abridging a right to speak through a law passed by Congress. This is an often unacknowledged flaw in our system: the role of the judiciary is often to cobble together rationalizations that allow contradictory laws to function in a semblance of harmony.</p>
