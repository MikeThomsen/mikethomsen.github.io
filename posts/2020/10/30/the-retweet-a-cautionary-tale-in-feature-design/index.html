      Posted on Fri 30 October 2020 in <a href="https://mikethomsen.github.io/category/opinion">opinion</a>

  <div>
    <p>In a quick <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-thomsen-780341191_the-retweet-is-an-unsung-example-of-an-idea-activity-6727366455811166208-G801">post on LinkedIn</a>, I singled out the Retweet as a great example of a much-loved feature that has turned out to be an unmitigated disaster for not just Twitter, but all of its peers. It's worth expanding on those points because it's a fascinating case in the intersection of how the Law of Unintentational Consequences and software engineering can have truly horrific results.</p>
<p>The approximate origins of the Retweet feature come from users whining about the extra steps involved in sharing someone else's posts. The herculean task of copying and pasting was too much for many users, so Twitter obliged them and automated that small amount of manual labor for them.</p>
<p>Unlike a quote feature, the Retweet allows you to just spam the heck out of your followers on Twitter. Though admittedly, unlike traditional spam, it's often sufficiently aligned with the tastes of the followers that it is more often welcomed than not.</p>
<p>What makes the feature so dangerous is that it reproduces data <strong>very</strong> rapidly. For Twitter and its less sophisticated rivals, too rapidly in many cases. Once a few influencers, taste-makers, etc. get ahold of something, the growth rate is probably exponential. The practical effect is if the wrong tweet gets the meat machinery of Twitter (and its competitors) going, it also increases the exposure to bad takes exponentially.</p>
<p>Now at this point, it shouldn't take a genius to realize the potential for causing chaos. Literally every negative aspect of Twitter and its peers gets amplified by this feature and its equivalents. A lot of people cannot grasp the hard truth that the features that let them have a chance of making something go viral work just as effectively in the hands of a foreign intelligence service trying to spread disinformation. The problem isn't the abuse, the problem is that the feature is an intrinsically attractive target for abuse no measure what counter-measures are put in place.</p>
<p>That brings us to another hard truth about this feature, which is that it mixes poorly with the average person's weak ability to tell random data points shoved in their face from a trend of such things happening generally. A lot of social outrage on social media is precisely this. One random bad act spins out of control today. Tomorrow another one gets spun up. People conclude from this retweet spam "it's a trend!" except it really isn't. It's random data points spun out of control and shoved into your face by an algorithm.</p>
<p>Much of the societal damage people see and struggle to describe comes from the ease with which social media feeds our darker impulses. One of those is the addicting nature of anger and outrage, especially as they feed off of self-righteousness and virtue-signaling. This not a new phenomenon; literally a good portion of all four gospels in the New Testament is devoted to Jesus doing rhetoric Judo on some self-righteous virtue-signaler. What is new is how modern technology has fed this tendency.</p>
<p>As software engineers, it's unlikely that any of us will ever contemplate a feature like this, mutter "what could go wrong?" and then look back 10 years later staring at societal scar tissue we caused. It is still a valuable lesson on why we shouldn't hesitate to expand on "what could go wrong" by saying "no, seriously, let's look at all of the ways this could be misued by our worst users."</p>
