title: No one...

No one cares if you are running the latest and greatest tech stack if your work isn't solving real needs and fixing real problems.

No one cares if you are a 100x software engineer if you don't bring value to your employer or client and act as a force multiplier for your colleagues' work.

No one respects your disruptive ideas if they bring more chaos and disruption than value and opportunity for others.

Someone else usually has to pick up the pieces when you "move fast and break things."
